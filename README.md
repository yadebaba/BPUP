I have been teaching "Bioinformatics Programing Using Perl" for several years at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. It is an optional course for students whose backgrounds are biology or medicine. In another word, it is given for the total beginners. I have also written a book for this course, which is in Chinese. The book has nine chapters. And this site accompanies with the book. For each chapter, all example scripts and corresponding data files are provided here. Hope this site is helpful for my students or other beginners.
